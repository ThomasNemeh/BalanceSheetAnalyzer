# BalanceSheetAnalyzer
Program to scan state bank balance sheets from Comptroller of the Currency Reports in the late 19th century, and transfer data from these balance sheets into excel.

This program was designed for the 1892 Vol. 2 report, but can be easily modified for other years.

The programs are carefully designed to extract data as accurately as possible, correcting for textual and spacing errors and flagging uncorrectable errors in the text.
